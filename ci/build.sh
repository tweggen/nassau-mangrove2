#
# THIS FILE IS IDENTICAL IN nassau-analogue, nassau-eq, nassau-mangrove2 and
# nassau-zermatt, the way ci/gates.sh already is. Nothing in it names a plugin:
# what this repo produces is read out of Source/Plugin/CMakeLists.txt and out of
# build/out. Fix a bug here and copy the file across; do not fork it.
#
# WHY THIS IS NOT ci/gates.sh. The gate pins everything so that a pass means the
# same thing on every machine: its own build-ci/ tree, an explicit
# NASSAU_SDK_DIR, and a ctest run every time. This is the developer's build —
# build/, whatever SDK the locator finds, tests only when asked. Keeping them in
# separate trees is also why running one does not invalidate the other.
#
# IT DOES NOT INSTALL, AND THAT IS A DECISION. iPlug2 defaults
# IPLUG_DEPLOY_PLUGINS=ON, which adds a POST_BUILD step copying every bundle it
# builds into ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/… — so building this repo standalone used
# to install it, silently, as a side effect. Two reasons that is wrong: a build
# must not modify anything outside its own tree (nassau-suite turns the same flag
# off, for the same reason, with the same note), and once it does, "which copy
# did the host just load?" stops having an answer. OFF here. ci/install.sh
# installs and says where; ci/install.sh --link gives back the fast
# edit-reload loop without giving back the ambiguity.
#
# THE SDK IS NOT RESOLVED HERE. cmake/NassauSDK.cmake owns that order — an
# explicit NASSAU_SDK_DIR, then a sibling ../nassau-plugin-sdk checkout, then a
# pinned FetchContent — and a second implementation is a second answer to the
# question of which SDK you built against. --sdk only forwards.
